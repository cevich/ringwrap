********************* DETAILS *********************
**************************************************/

This program allows an arbitrary wrapper command to be 
asynchronously enabled and disabled around an arbitrary 
primary command.  Once activated, the program will begin 
executing the wrapper command with the primary as it's 
final argument.

The intended use is, modifying the behavior of the primary 
command, from outside of it's execution context.  Enabling,
or disabling the wrapping at will, and gathering execution
statistics.

For example, consider a network service that forks a new 
server for each connection.  You can drop in ringwrap 
as the "server" in the configuration once, only to initialize 
and/or run limited straces or logging on it later w/o 
having to restart or interrupt the service. 

The --keep and --outdir options enhance the functionality 
by generating a unique output directory and filename for 
each run, then purging all but the most recent.  The 
filename is passed via the magic sequence "@@@" in the
wrapped command.

The filename will be in the form:

<outdir>/YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS_PID/<command>

The magic squence is not yet supported for use in the primary
command.

If multiple instances of the same command will be wrapped with
differing output options, the --unique option may be used to
distinguish them.

Shared memory segments and semaphores are used to serialize
access to wrapping state as well as output.  This is intended
for cases where hundreds or thousands of wrapped commands
may be executing at the same time.
